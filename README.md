# SAT Vocabulary Trainer

### Overview
The **SAT Vocabulary Trainer** is an interactive Python program designed to help users improve their vocabulary in preparation for the SAT exam. It uses a repetition-based learning system to reinforce knowledge and track progress across multiple levels of difficulty.

### Key Features
- **Vocabulary & Suffix Levels**: Offers 50 levels of SAT vocabulary words and 14 levels of common suffixes.
- **Randomized Word Selection**: Encourages memory retention through randomized word quizzes.
- **Customizable Learning**: Users can select specific levels to focus on areas of weakness.
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks the number of correct and incorrect answers in each session.

### How It Works
1. **Choose a Mode**: 
   - Vocabulary or Suffixes.
2. **Pick a Level**: 
   - Select from 50 vocabulary levels or 14 suffix levels.
3. **Interactive Learning**: 
   - Random words or suffixes are presented for review. You indicate whether you’re familiar with the word or not.
4. **Repetition**: 
   - Words marked as unfamiliar are repeated until they are mastered.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamza-69/sat-vocab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:  
   ```bash
   cd sat-vocab
   ```
3. Install necessary dependencies (if any).
4. Run the program:  
   ```bash

   ```
